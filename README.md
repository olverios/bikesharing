## Summary:

In the analysis of the information it was found that

- The hours of greatest demand are between 7 and 9 in the morning and between 5 and 7 in the afternoon.
- On the other hand the trips last between 0 and 20 minutes in their majority, there were few or none that lasted more than an hour.
- Some recommendations would be to have the greatest number of bicycles available during peak hours and for maintenance at dawn or in the middle of the day.
- Some improvements could be to add visualization by map in case the data has zone data.
